# Rationale behind the BERT model

## BERT is a transformer-based model, and its key innovation
# lies in the concept of bidirectionality. Unlike traditional
# language models that read text in one direction (e.g., from left to right or right to left),
# BERT employs a bidirectional context prediction technique. It predicts each word based
# on the words that come before and after it, thus capturing richer contextual information.

# Since we have to use transfer learning to fine tune this classification , so BERT is a good choice
# Transfer Learning: BERT's pre-trained weights are valuable knowledge
# that can be transferred to downstream NLP tasks. By fine-tuning BERT on
# a specific task, it can adapt its contextual embeddings to the
# task-specific domain, leading to better performance with fewer labeled training samples.

# In the context of the provided problem statement
# (classifying articles), using BERT allows the model
# to leverage its pre-trained knowledge of language, context,
# and semantics. Fine-tuning BERT on the task-specific dataset
#  enables it to learn to classify articles based on the textual
# information present in the 'paragraph' column and predict the corresponding category ('news_list') effectively.




### Rationale behind the Evaluation metrics -  Classification Report,Accuracy_Score

# To evaluate the predictions of the BERT model,
# we can use several standard evaluation metrics
#  that are commonly used for multi-class classification tasks.
# Here are some of the main metrics along with their rationales:

# Classification Report: The classification report combines precision, recall, F1 score, and support for each class in a compact format.

# Rationale: The classification report provides a comprehensive summary of the model's performance for all classes.
# It is a convenient way to compare the model's metrics across different classes.


#Accuracy: Accuracy is the most straightforward metric and measures the proportion of correctly predicted labels out of all the samples in the dataset.
# It is a simple and intuitive metric that provides an overall assessment of the model's performance.

# Rationale: Accuracy is useful when the classes in the dataset are balanced, i.e.,
#  there are approximately equal samples for each class. However, accuracy may not
#  be suitable for imbalanced datasets, where one class dominates the others,
# as it can be misleading and mask the true performance of the model.
